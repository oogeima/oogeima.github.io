Starting Odin Project!
- Motivational first lessons along with setup.  More or less skipping those
  because I'm a bad student.
- Question asking articles.  They look neat!
- Stuff on basics for networks, computers, internet, etc.
- Installation stuff, mostly skipped because I'm already setup.
    - Editor setup.  Don't use MS Word.
- Basic CLI stuff, skipping.
- Basic GitHub usage.
- Basic HTML/CSS.
- Now onto Project Recipe!
    - [Done](https://oogeima.github.io/odin-recipes/).
