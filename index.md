Starting Odin Project!

- Starting at 10:20p.
- Motivational first lessons along with setup.  More or less skipping those
  because I'm a bad student.
- Question asking articles.  They look neat!
- Stuff on basics for networks, computers, internet, etc.
- Installation stuff, mostly skipped because I'm already setup.
    - Editor setup.  Don't use MS Word.
- Basic CLI stuff, skipping.
- Basic GitHub usage.
- Basic HTML/CSS.
- Now onto Project Recipe!
    - [Done][recipes].
- CSS lessons.
    - Learned a new thing about [`box-sizing`][box-sizing].
    - [`gap`][gap] is cool, too.
- Got sort of wrecked on CSS Froggy.  Thanks, voice chat!
- Next project - landing page.  Stopping for the night at 12:15a.
